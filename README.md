# AudioKeys

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kylestetz/AudioKeys.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/kylestetz/AudioKeys)

#### Bring your own sound.

Use AudioKeys to power the typing keyboard in your next Web Audio project. AudioKeys provides **intelligent handling of key events**, giving you key up and key down events that you can use to trigger your sounds.

AudioKeys provides **configurable polyphony**— if you're making a monophonic synth, choose from the common note priorities "last note", "first note", "highest note", or "lowest note". It also handles odd situations like switching tabs— AudioKeys fires a note off event when your browser window goes out of focus.

Choose from two common key layouts, one of which supports optional octave shifting and velocity selecting.

# Installation

#### Using `npm`

```bash
$ npm install audiokeys --save
```

Use it in your project by requiring or importing it, depending on your build system.

```javascript
// Using `require`
const AudioKeys = require('audiokeys');

// Using `import`
import AudioKeys from 'audiokeys';
```

#### Grab the source directly

Download [`dist/audiokeys.js`](https://github.com/kylestetz/AudioKeys/blob/master/dist/audiokeys.js) or [`dist/audiokeys.min.js`](https://github.com/kylestetz/AudioKeys/blob/master/dist/audiokeys.min.js) and include it in the `<head>` of your markup:
```html
<script src="/js/audiokeys.js"></script>
```

Now you will have the `AudioKeys(options)` function available to use.

---

# Usage

```javascript
// create a keyboard
var keyboard = new AudioKeys();

keyboard.down( function(note) {
  // do things with the note object
});

keyboard.up( function(note) {
  // do things with the note object
});
```

##### The note object has cool stuff in it.

The object you get back in a `down` or `up` callback includes:

```javascript
{
  // the midi number of the note
  note: 60,
  // the keyCode of the key being pressed down
  keyCode: 65,
  // the frequency of the note
  frequency: 261.6255653005986,
  // on note down: the current velocity (this can only be set when rows = 1)
  // on note up: 0
  velocity: 127
}
```

These properties will be useful in setting up oscillators. See the [`test/index.html`](https://github.com/kylestetz/AudioKeys/blob/master/test/index.html) file for a simple example.

### API

There are several options that can be set to configure your keyboard object. They can be passed into the `AudioKeys` constructor in an object or set individually using `set`.

```javascript
// properties can be passed into the AudioKeys object
var keyboard = new AudioKeys({
  polyphony: 1,
  rows: 2,
  priority: 'lowest'
});

// all properties can also be set later
keyboard.set('priority', 'highest');
```

##### `keyboard.set(property, value)`
##### `keyboard.get(property, value)`

The state of the keyboard can be read and changed using the `set` and `get` methods. Here are the properties:

###### `polyphony`
The number of keys that can be active simultaneously.

###### `rows`
Either `1` or `2`, see the diagrams above.

###### `octaveControls`
Determines whether or not the `z` and `x` keys shift octaves when `rows` is set to `1`.

###### `velocityControls`
Determines whether or not the number keys set the velocity of the notes being triggered. Keep in mind that velocity is just a number— you have to interpret it in your sounds!

###### `priority`
Determines the priority of the note triggers. Priority only takes effect when the number of keys being pressed down exceeds the polyphony (e.g. when the polyphony is 1 but a second key is pressed).

- `"last"`: prefer the last note(s) pressed
- `"first"`: prefer the first note(s) pressed
- `"highest"`: prefer the highest note(s) pressed
- `"lowest"`: prefer the lowest note(s) pressed

For more on note priority, check out [this Sound on Sound article](https://web.archive.org/web/20150913012148/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct00/articles/synthsec.htm).

###### `rootNote`
Determines what note the lowest key on the keyboard will represent. The default is `60` (C4). Keep in mind that setting it to a note other than C (36, 48, 60, 72, 84, etc.) will result in the key mappings not lining up like a regular keyboard!

###### `layoutIndependentMapping`

Whether to identify keyboardEvents using the keyboard layout-independent `e.code` instead of the (deprecated) QWERTY-only `e.keyCode`.
`true` recommended.
Default: `false` for backward-compatibility.
